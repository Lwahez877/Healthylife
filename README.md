# Healthylife
Have you ever wondered about the definition of health? How can a person be healthy? According to the World Health Organization (WHO), health is “a complete state of physical, mental and social well-being, not merely the absence of illness or disability”. We offer a list of steps that can help you if you follow a healthy life.
